## Scrapy-Scout
**Scrapy-Scout** is a series of python scripts that scrape the last 40 years (1979-2018) of player selections in the four major US sports leagues.

The scripts utilizes the scrapy package and scrapes *ProFootballReference.com, Basketball-reference.com, Hockey-reference.com*, and *Baseball-reference.com* and exports csvs with relavent player, team, and statistical metrics.

The included R scripts load, process, and allow the user to perform a cross-sport analysis, by normalizing state of the art player evaluation metrics in each of the four sports.
